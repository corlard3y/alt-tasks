        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Kolade Oyewumi. I am a 26-year-old passionate learner and tech enthusiast with a strong interest in software development and engineering. I graduated from the prestigious University of Ilorin, where I obtained a degree that laid the foundation for my journey in technology.
          
          <br /> 
          <br /> 
          My time at the university exposed me to the limitless possibilities of technology and how it can transform industries and empower individuals. Over the years, I have worked on various projects across sectors such as education, healthcare, and logistics, which enhanced my technical skills and honed my ability to work collaboratively with teams to achieve common goals. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading books on personal development, and mentoring aspiring tech enthusiasts. My journey so far has been one of continuous learning, growth, and a determination to make a difference. I am excited about the future and the opportunities to build impactful solutions that address real-world challenges.

      <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
      <p>
        I joined the Alt School Engineering program because it provides a unique opportunity 
        to gain practical, hands-on experience in the field of software engineering. The 
        program's focus on real-world projects, mentorship, and peer collaboration aligns 
        perfectly with my career goals and aspirations.

        <br /> 
        <br /> 

        My desire to transition into cloud engineering is driven by a passion to build on my
        existing knowledge and gain expertise in cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and
        Google Cloud. I am particularly eager to learn how to design, deploy, and manage cloud
        infrastructure that supports large-scale applications while ensuring security, reliability,
        and cost-eﬃciency

        <br /> 
        <br /> 

        My goal is to become a proficient cloud engineer capable of designing and
        implementing cloud solutions that enhance the scalability, security, and performance of
        applications. I am especially passionate about using cloud technology to drive innovation
        in sectors such as healthcare, education, and logistics—areas where I have already made
        significant contributions as a software engineer . By transitioning into cloud engineering, I
        will be better equipped to develop solutions that address critical issues in these sectors,
        ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals and communities across Africa.
